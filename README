Tokyo Zip code [Tokyo Postal Code] PHP Program.

2 Drop-down menus for a HTMLform.

Choosing the zipcode in the 1st drop-down menu, will display the name of district in the second drop-down menu.


Needs:

A file called 'TokyoPostalCodes.xlsx' for the name of the districts in Tokyo. 
// Do not need this file because the data are already inside the 2 tables: 'data' and 'data_parent'


2 databases ['data' and 'data_parent'] + 1 database ['registrer'] for the result [here MySQL databases]

2 Javascript files : 'jquery-1.8.1.js' and 'func.js'.

How does it work:

HTML Files: 'contact.php' (the form) and 'contact_off.html' (when the form is validated).


PHP Files:

'db.php' ==> to connect to the database

'ajax_city' ==> to do a query in MySQL


'register1.php' ==> to select and output the result in the 'registrer' table.

 // The result of this file is not perfect here, not in the right parsing format. 
//  I will need some help here.
